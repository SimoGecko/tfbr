### Description
‘That Failed Bank Robbery’ is a competitive local multiplayer game for 2 or 4 players in which two teams of thieves try to rob the same bank at the same time. The goal of the game is to collect the most money before the round ends or the getaway vehicle is destroyed. Each player in the game controls a vehicle and can collect money by opening vaults, cracking crates or collecting valuables present on the map. Players can also steal their opponent’s loot by attacking them or their base. The game is set inside Credit Suisse and features a wide array of power-ups and different valuables and riches. The more money a player collects before bringing it to its base, the riskier the play becomes, as vehicles move slower and have impaired attack when loaded. This provides a fun layer of quick and dirty action on top of a more strategic game in which several tactics can bring to victory.
The game is developed by Simone Guggiari, Nicolas Huart, Alexander Lexus, Andreas Emch and Xingze Tian as a project for the Game Programming Laboratory offered at ETH Zürich in the Spring Semester of 2018 under the supervision of Prof. Robert Sumner.
